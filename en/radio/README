Radio is yet to be invented. Again.
===================================

Radio was considered very hardware bounded
technology. You need Radio Frequency front end,
you need digital signal processing hardware,
and then comes some high-level software stuff.

But now, with the concept of SDR (Software Defined Radio),
it all changed. As now the personal computer processing
power (together with the parrallel processing power of graphics engine),
many radio technologies that was once existed only on
dedicated hardware can now also be implemented in pure software.
Heard about LTE? [Fabrice Bellard implemented a LTE base station in
software](http://bellard.org/lte/ "LTE in Software").

The even more exciting thing is, with USRP you can afford
such an SDR platform just at home. Oh yes, you still need
some hardware for SDR, but basically the hardware does is to
down convert the radio fequency signal to base band frequency signal
and sample the base band signal with a very high speed analog to
digital converter and vice versa. And there the creativity goes ;-)
