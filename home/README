This is the home page of Hua Yanghao, documenting various technologies and ideas
which he wants to share with you.

It took quite some time to build this site, a site that he understands every
gut of it. First he tried Django, then google appengine. But these all doesn't
work out so well. For what he needs is an extremely simple to maintain, fast
to serve and flexible to change web site infrastructure, and there should be
no black box in such a setup.

Finally, he gets to develop it from scratch, and it took only a week to do so.
Much faster than reading the specs and manual of the existing frameworks.

This is the place for fun, and hopefully you enjoyed your stay here.

Good luck and have fun.
